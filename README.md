# sentiment_analysis
This repository contains my Sentiment Analysis Model that is built to classify text as positive and negative with high accuracy and balanced performance metrics.

## Performance Highlights:
- Accuracy: 79.87%
- Precision: 79.89%
- Recall: 79.87%
- F1-Score: 79.86%
## Project Overview:
Sentiment analysis is one of the most important techniques for extracting meaningful insights from textual data, such as product reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback. This project demonstrates how NLP techniques and machine learning models can be used to effectively classify sentiment in text.

# Key Features:
## Data Preprocessing:
- Text cleaning (removal of noise, stopwords, and punctuation).
- Tokenization and lemmatization to standardize textual input.
## Model Architecture:
- Built using Logistic Regression.
- Tfidf vectorizer for transforming textual data.
## Testing:
- Comprehensive testing with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Balanced performance on each of the sentiment classes positive and negative.
## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python.
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy.
- Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn for confusion matrix and performance visualization.
